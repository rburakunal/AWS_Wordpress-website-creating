# AWS_Wordpress-website-creating
Created Random Wordpress Website on AWS. In this process, VPC, LB, RDS and EC2 services used. NGİNX used as webserver.  
Steps of The Project:
●Default VPC will not be used. You need to create a new VPC. 
●Incoming traffic requests should not come directly to the Web Application from Loadbalancer. Nginx should be used as the web server.
●My SQL on RDS is expected to be used. 
●Infrastructure should be high-available except RDS.
